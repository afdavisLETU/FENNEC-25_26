Welcome:) Here's some helpful startup info on FENNEC-25_26 git repo
This repo contains each data science member's code for their respective question for fennec 2025-26
Our machine learning data processing library fennec-ml (https://github.com/afdavisLETU/fennec-ml) holds our general purpose fennec data processing functions.


Necessary Libraries to run FENNEC 2025-2026 code (I'd recommend installing these in a venv):
- pytorch
- tensorflow
- keras
- ipykernel (to use jupyter notebook codes)
- pandas
- fennec-ml

If on Mac:
- install apple metal architecture for tensorflow
- use python 3.12 as interpreter in venv bc metal isn't supported yet in later python versions (as of 10/2/25)
- helpful install guide here https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/

Folders:

DATA - root data folder, git ignores this, it's the working directory for all data storage
testing_data - a folder to hold test data for fennec-ml example. git also ignores this
Micah - what Micah's working on
Justin - What Justin's working on
Wills - what... you get the point
